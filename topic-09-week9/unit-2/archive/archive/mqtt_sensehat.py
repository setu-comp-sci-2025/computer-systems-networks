"""
MQTT Message Subscriber with Sense HAT LED Display

This script demonstrates how to subscribe to MQTT messages and use a 
Raspberry Pi's Sense HAT LED matrix to provide visual feedback. When a 
message is received from the MQTT broker, the LED matrix flashes with 
random colours for 2 seconds. This is useful for creating IoT applications 
where remote events trigger local visual notifications on the Raspberry Pi.

Key Components:
- MQTT Client: Connects to a broker and subscribes to messages
- Sense HAT LED Matrix: Displays visual feedback when messages arrive
- Callback Functions: Handle connection and message reception events
- Event Loop: Continuously listens for incoming MQTT messages
